- ✅ **Mixed Sibling Detection**: Identifies incomplete family classifications
- ✅ **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations with family context

### 4. **📊 Enhanced User Interfaces**

#### **Main Dashboard** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **Two-Tab Navigation**: Traditional financial analysis + Advanced classification
- ✅ **Real-Time Stats**: Shows classification status and issues
- ✅ **Seamless Integration**: Data flows between both interfaces

#### **Family Analysis Dashboard** (`components/classification/FamilyBasedClassificationDashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ **Executive Summary**: Over-classification, mixed siblings, perfect families
- ✅ **Priority Issues**: Sorted by financial impact with actionable guidance
- ✅ **Family Detail Analysis**: Drill-down for individual family problems

#### **Smart Classification Modal** (`components/classification/FamilyAwareClassificationModal.tsx`)
- ✅ **Family Context Display**: Shows sibling patterns and completeness
- ✅ **Conflict Prevention**: Real-time warnings for over-classification
- ✅ **Intelligent Suggestions**: Based on family patterns and history

#### **Classification Rules Manager** (`components/classification/ClassificationRulesManager.tsx`)
- ✅ **Complete Rule Management**: View, edit, and track all classification rules
- ✅ **Retroactive Impact Preview**: See exactly what will be affected before applying
- ✅ **History Tracking**: Full audit trail for each account across all reports
- ✅ **Search and Filtering**: Find rules by code, family, hierarchy level, or status

### 5. **🛠️ Advanced Technical Implementation**

#### **API Routes**
- ✅ `/api/classification/validate-families` - Server-side family validation
- ✅ `/api/classification/update-retroactive` - Retroactive classification updates
- ✅ Additional routes for suggestions, history, and rule management

#### **Services**
- ✅ **SophisticatedBottomUpValidator**: Core validation engine
- ✅ **FamilyAwareClassificationService**: Smart classification logic
- ✅ **ClassificationContext**: Shared state management

#### **Database Schema**
- ✅ **classification_rules**: Central repository of all classification rules
- ✅ **account_hierarchies**: Precise family relationship tracking
- ✅ **hierarchy_alerts**: Issue detection and alerting
- ✅ **family_validation_results**: Validation result summaries

## 🔄 Retroactive Classification Workflow

### **How It Works**
1. **User Updates Classification**: Either through the rules manager or smart modal
2. **Impact Analysis**: System shows exactly which reports will be affected
3. **Rule Creation/Update**: Creates or updates the master classification rule
4. **Retroactive Application**: Automatically updates ALL historical data
5. **Audit Trail**: Logs all changes for compliance and tracking

### **Example Scenario**
```
User changes account "5000-1002-001-001" from "Materiales" to "Materia Prima"
→ System finds 15 reports spanning 2 years with this account
→ Shows impact: 47 records totaling $2.3M will be updated
→ User confirms → All historical data automatically updated
→ Future imports automatically use the new classification
```

## 🎨 User Experience Features
