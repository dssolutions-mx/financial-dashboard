# Modal Fix Summary

## Problem
The modals in the main dashboard were broken after the recent mobile responsiveness changes. Users couldn't upload Excel files because the validation modal wasn't displaying properly.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by mobile-specific styling that was added to the `DialogContent` component in recent commits. The styling included:
- `fixed inset-0 w-full h-full max-w-none max-h-none m-0 rounded-none border-0 p-0` for mobile
- Complex conditional styling throughout the modal content

This caused the modals to break and not display properly.

## Solution
Reverted the problematic mobile-specific styling changes while preserving the core functionality:

### Changes Made:

1. **Validation Modal (`components/modals/validation-modal.tsx`)**:
   - Removed complex mobile-specific `DialogContent` styling
   - Restored standard modal sizing: `max-w-4xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto`
   - Simplified header structure back to standard `DialogHeader`/`DialogTitle`/`DialogDescription`
   - Removed conditional mobile styling throughout the component
   - Removed unused `useIsMobile` import and variable

2. **Enhanced Debug Modal (`components/modals/enhanced-debug-modal.tsx`)**:
   - Removed complex mobile-specific `DialogContent` styling
   - Restored standard modal sizing: `max-w-[95vw] max-h-[95vh] w-[95vw] p-0 overflow-hidden`
   - Simplified header structure

## Result
- Excel file upload functionality is now working again
- Validation modal displays properly
- Debug modal displays properly
- File uploads can proceed normally through the dashboard

## Testing
The application should now allow:
1. Clicking "Cargar Excel" button
2. Selecting an Excel file
3. Validation modal appears and functions correctly
4. File processing continues normally

The modals now use standard Radix UI Dialog patterns without the problematic mobile-specific overrides that were causing the display issues.
